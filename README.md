# California Wildfires 2013-2019: Trends among the data

Project description: As the effects of climate change become ever present in our world, environmental destruction is starting to become more of a commonality rather than a rarity. One such effect of climate change is the increase in wildfires, as seen within the state of California. The purpose of this project was to use statistical analysis and data visualization tools to find trends among this dataset that could be helpful for prevention of wildfires as well as any points for future analysis.
